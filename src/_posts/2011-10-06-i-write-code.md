I'm Matthew Loberg and I write code. During the day I'm a web developer in Minneapolis, MN. At night I work on side projects of mine. I love writing code, I love making things, I love taking a problem that a client may have and finding an effective solution in the form of a website. I also love taking a problem and seeing how I can best solve it.

Here I will posting about code and other development related topics. You can see some of my code over at [Github](https://github.com/mloberg) as well as [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/mloberg) for smaller quick projects. You can also follow me on Twitter, [@mloberg](http://twitter.com/mloberg).
