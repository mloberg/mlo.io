Writing is something I see a lot of developers struggle with. They can write
complex algorithms, but when it comes to communicating with another person, they
struggle. I was a terrible writer. I'm still not great, but I've learned enough
over the years to get by. I wanted to share some of what I've learned over the
years.

## Avoid Filler Words

The article that sparked me writing this post started sentences with "so". This
bothered me because this was something I did in the past and have seen otherwise
smart people do. It doesn't add any value to your sentence and can weaken the
meaning. I believe this stems from a lack of confidence, and this can be picked
up in your writing. The article was otherwise informative and useful, but lacked
authority in the delivery.

> So I was using this tool the other day and I wanted to talk about it.

This also goes for other filler words. You're not trying to write a paper that
has to meet a page requirement. Adding these filler words can weaken your writing
and how it's received. Avoid words like "really", "just", and ["very"](https://www.proofreadingservices.com/pages/very).

## Use an Active Voice

Passive voice in writing is when the subject of your sentence is acted upon by
something else. To make your writing more engaging, instead have the subject be
doing the action.

How do you spot passive voice? Look for words like "is" and "be" before a verb.
That may tell you if the sentence is using passive voice. This can be tough to
determine, so don't be afraid to use a [writing tool](#use-tools-to-help-your-writing)
to help you out.

A couple notes on passive voice, it [isn't always correct](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/passive-voice/),
and in technical focused writing can be hard to accomplish at times. But by making
an effort to make your writing more active, it will make it more direct and
engaging.

## Use Tools To Help Your Writing

I'm not a great writer. While I know these rules I've listed, it can be hard to
spot them in my own writing. When I'm focused on getting content down, I'm not
paying attention to these rules. That's why I rely on tools to help me out.

### write good

[write good](https://github.com/btford/write-good) is my favorite out of this list.
I run it before I publish any blog posts. I also use the [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=travisthetechie.write-good-linter)
to check any documentation I'm working on.

### alex

I use [alex](https://alexjs.com/) to catch any potentially insensitive writing.
It doesn't change the meaning of my writing and makes it more inclusive.

### Grammarly

You've probably heard of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/), but it's become
something I use frequently. I like the ability to set goals and audience in a
document so I can make sure I'm coming across how I want to be. For everyday
writing, the combination of _write good_ and _alex_ works, but when I want to
sound professional, I reach for Grammarly. At time it feels slightly overpriced,
but has been useful to me. If you're looking for free options, stick with the
tools listed above.

feelings on the product.

## Write Better

Even if you're not an English major or struggled with English in school, these
tips and tools should help you start writing better. At the very least, please
stop using "so" to start sentences.
