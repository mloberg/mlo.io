		<h3>I'm Matthew Loberg <small>and here's a little bit about me</small></h3>

		<p>I'm a server administator and web developer from St Paul, Minnesota. I learned how to design web sites at a young age and have been doing it ever since. My skills and abilities have grown and continue to grow. I known HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP very well and learn new languages and technologies all the time.</p>

		<p>I moved from Brainerd to St Paul after graduating high school. I got a job doing data entry at a small agency in Minneapolis. During this time I developed my own PHP framework and continued to refine my skills. After about 6 months, I moved into a full time web developer position where I developed web sites for Cargill, the University of Minnesota, and other companies. About a year later I took a server admin position at Capstone Digital where I manage the infrastructure that supports 30,000 (and growing) daily active users.</p>

		<p>I'm always learning new languages, tools, technologies, and refining my current skills. I continue to work on my <a href="http://github.com/mloberg/Tea-Fueled-Does">PHP framework</a>, which I <a href="http://github.com/mloberg">open sourced</a> along with multiple other <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a>.</p>
