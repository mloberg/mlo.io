		<h3>I'm Matthew Loberg</h3>
		<p>Here's a couple things about me.</p>
		
		<h4>I am a Web Developer</h4>
		<p>I'm a web developer in Minneapolis, MN. I work creating custom websites and applications using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. On the side I work on side-projects and learn new technologies and languages.</p>
		
		<h4>I am a Learner</h4>
		<p>I'm not satisfied with what I know. That's why I'm always trying to learn new things and how to do things better. I read blogs, look at source code, and follow some great developers on Twitter, Github and Forrst. I also write code to test out the things I've read or test theories I get at lunch or in the middle of the night.</p>

		<h4>I am a Problem Solver</h4>
		<p>Give me a problem and will try to solve it in the most efficient way. I'll write code and change it multiple times until I get the best solution.</p>

		<h4>I am Passionate</h4>
		<p>I love what I do. I'm not satisfied with "good enough", I strive for better. I want to make a product that doesn't just work, but works the best it can.</p>

		<h4>I am Obsessed</h4>
		<p>My job is writing code. You know what I do for fun? Code. I write code libraries, apps, etc. a lot of which I <a href="http://github.com/mloberg">release for free</a>. I also have a couple <a href="/project/index.html">side-projects</a> that I work on. One of my main projects is Tea-Fueled Does, a PHP 5.3 framework.</p>

		<h4>I am a Coder</h4>
		<p>I write code. I love it. Check out some of my <a href="/projects/index.html">projects</a> to get an idea of what I do.</p>
