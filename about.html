<h3>I am Matthew Loberg</h3>
<p>Here's a couple things about me.</p>
<h4>I am a web developer</h4>
<p>I work at <a href="http://dkyinc.com">DKY Inc</a> in Minneapolis. DKY is a small agency with some big name clients. Winnebago, Cargill, General Mills, Toro, and many other clients. I work with PHP, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. to create custom web sites and applications.</p>
<h4>I am a learner</h4>
<p>I'm not satisfied with what I know. That's why I'm always trying to learn new things and how to do things better. I read blogs, look at source code, and follow some great developers on <a href="http://twitter.com/mloberg">Twitter</a> and <a href="">Forrst</a>. I also write code to test out the things I've read or test theories I get at lunch, in the middle of the night, when I'm showering, etc.</p>
<h4>I am a problem solver</h4>
<p>Give me a problem and will try to solve it in the most efficient way. I'll write code and change it multiple times until I get the best solution.</p>
<h4>I am passionate</h4>
<p>I love what I do. I'm not satisfied with "good enough", I strive for better. I want to make a product that doesn't just work, but works the best it can.</p>
<h4>I am obsessed</h4>
<p>My job is writing code. You know what I do for fun? Code. I write code libraries, apps, etc. a lot of which I <a href="#github">release for free</a>. I also have a couple side-projects that I work on. One of those is <a href="http://photographr.me">Photographr</a>, a startup for photographers. I also have spent the greater part of the year on a PHP framework (which powers this site). While I am obsessed with code, I do have other hobbies (I don't want to get burnt out on code). In those things I am very passionate and obsessed with doing the best I can.</p>
<h4>I am a coder</h4>
<p>I write code. I love it. Check out some of my <a href="/work">work</a> and <a href="/projects">projects</a> to get an idea of what I do.</p>
