The past couple of weeks I've been working with [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/), and all I really have to say is wow! If you've worked with Linux at all, I bet it's been Ubuntu, and don't get me wrong, Ubuntu is great, but Arch is awesome. Arch focuses on simplicity and it does a good job of it. As a beginner, you could set up a server with Arch and not run into any issues. It's also has a unique release system that's always up-to-date. Everyday I've logged in any there's always a new update, with this update system, you can make sure you are always running the latest and greatest, with other systems you'd have to wait 6 or more months for a update.

You can follow this [guide](http://lifehacker.com/5680453/build-a-killer-customized-arch-linux-installation-and-learn-all-about-linux-in-the-process) and get an idea of how easy Arch is to use, all while you gain an understanding of what's going on underneath the surface. If you're installing a server, don't worry about installing ASLA or X.

Arch also has a really great [Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Main_Page) that has some guides to get you going with an [SSH server](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ssh), a [LAMP server](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LAMP), [FTP server](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vsftpd), or almost anything you could need.

The [package manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) that Arch uses is pretty slick. Like I said earlier, it's always up to date, and includes a good number of packages. There's also a [user managed repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/), which you can find anything you're looking for. While there are a couple of [extra steps involved](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR) in installing a packing from the AUR, it's a lot easier then building from source.

If you're looking for a distro to run your next server, I fully recommend Arch Linux.
