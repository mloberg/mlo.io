This site has been using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) since 2011 and hosted
on AWS since 2014. During that time I've learned a lot about the ins and outs
of using Jekyll and static sites in AWS. In this talk, share what I've learned
since moving to AWS and walk you through deploying your Jekyll site to AWS.

Thanks to [JekyllConf](https://jekyllconf.com/) and
[CloudCanon](https://cloudcannon.com/) for allowing me to give this talk.
