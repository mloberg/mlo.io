## about me

I'm Matt and I'm a web developer from Minnesota. I've worked on sites that range from small static sites to complex high-availability web applications. I've done everything from front-end work to back-end work to server administration.

You can find my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mloberg) and get in contact with me through [email](ma&#105;lto&#58;m&#64;&#109;lo&#98;&#37;65%&#55;2g&#46;&#99;&#111;m).
