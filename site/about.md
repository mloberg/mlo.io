I'm Matt, a software engineer, nerd, musician, vegetarian, and bad joke
connoisseur. I'm passionate about using software to improve people's lives.

Some previous jobs I've had involved data scraping, ETL, DevOps, web
development, and photography. I've worked on a lot of things, everything from
small static sites to complex high-availability web applications. Through all of
this and side projects I've gained a lot of knowledge on database design, system
administration, API development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, high-availability, cloud
computing, and everything in between.

In my free time I enjoy writing, recording, and playing [music](https://soundcloud.com/mloberg).
