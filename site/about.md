I'm Matt, a software engineer, nerd, musician, vegetarian, and bad joke
connoisseur. I live in Minneapolis, which is pretty awesome most of the year if
you can survive the snow.

I work as a software engineer at [The Nerdery](https://nerdery.com/)
doing PHP. The Nerdery is an awesome place and if you need any software design
or development, [contact them](http://nerdery.com/contact).

Some previous jobs I've had involved data scraping, ETL, DevOps, web
development, and photography. I've worked on a lot of things, everything from
small static sites to complex high-availability web applications. Through all of
this and side projects I've gained a lot of knowledge on database design, system
administration, APIs and API development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
high-availability, cloud computing, and everything in between.

In my free time I enjoy writing, recording, and playing [music](https://soundcloud.com/mloberg).
