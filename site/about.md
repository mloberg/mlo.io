I'm Matt, a software engineer at [The Nerdery](http://www.nerdery.com/people#rb). My main language is PHP, but I also know Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Bash, and more. I've worked on small static sites to complex high-availability web applications. Everything from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to APIs, database design, system administration and everything in between.
In my free time I enjoy writing, recording, and playing music.
