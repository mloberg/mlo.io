I'm Matt, a developer, nerd, musician, vegetarian, and bad joke connoisseur.
I live in Minneapolis, which is pretty awesome most of the year if you can
survive the snow.

I work as a software engineer at [The Nerdery](http://www.nerdery.com/people#rb)
doing PHP. The Nerdery is an awesome place and if you need any software design
or development, [contact them](http://nerdery.com/contact).

Some previous jobs I've had involved data scraping, ETL, DevOps, web
development, and photography, so I've worked on a lot of things.
Everything from small static sites to complex high-availability web
applications. Through all of this and side projects I've gained a lot of
knowledge on database design, system administration, APIs and API development,
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, high-availability, cloud computing, and everything in
between.

In my free time I enjoy writing, recording, and playing [music](https://soundcloud.com/mloberg).
