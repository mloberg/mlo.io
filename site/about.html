<h2>about me</h2>

<p>I currently work as a server administrator managing and scaling a cloud infrastructure. In the past I have worked as a web applications developer creating PHP websites backed with a MySQL database. </p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy hacking in Ruby, Node, PHP, and Bash, learning new tools and languages, and writing music.</p>

<p>You can find my code on <a href="https://github.com/mloberg">GitHub</a> or get in contact with me through <a href="http://twitter.com/mloberg">Twitter</a> or <a href='ma&#105;lto&#58;m&#64;&#109;lo&#98;&#37;65%&#55;2g&#46;&#99;&#111;m'>email me</a>.</p>
