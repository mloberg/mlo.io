		<h3>Tea-Fueled Does</h3>
		<p>Tea-Fueled Does is a 5.3 PHP framework I've been developing for the past year. It was born out of the disappointment of the frameworks available at the time. It focuses on being extendible and clean.<br /><small><a href="https://github.com/mloberg/Tea-Fueled-Does">View Project on GitHub</a></small></p>

		<h3>Playr</h3>
		<p>Playr is a community music manager written in Ruby. I wrote a <a href="/blog/2012/02/18/playr-the-ruby-music-manager.html">blog post</a> on it.<br /><small><a href="https://github.com/mloberg/Playr">View Project on GitHub</a></small></p>

		<h3>SimpleWiki</h3>
		<p>I needed an easy way to keep the TFD docs up to date when it was in active development. I didn't want to deal with a database and I liked to use markdown to format the docs. After not finding something that would work, I built my own wiki. It has since then been replaced with a Jekyll setup.<br /><small><a href="https://github.com/mloberg/Simple-Wiki">View Project on GitHub</a></small></p>

		<h3>Launch Page</h3>
		<p>Styled off of LaunchRock, Launch Page is a launching soon page for startups. It collects email address to a MailChimp list.<br /><small><a href="https://github.com/mloberg/Launch-Page">View Project on GitHub</a></small></p>

		<h3>Last.fm PHP Class</h3>
		<p>One of my first real code projects, Tea-Fueled Last.fm Class is a PHP class that interacts with the Last.fm API.<br /><small><a href="https://github.com/mloberg/Tea-Fueled-Last.fm-PHP-Class">View Project on GitHub</a></small></p>
